# Social Network Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing **social network** data to understand various properties such as community structure, clustering coefficients, graph diameter, and privacy-preserving techniques.

## Features
- Data analysis with various metrics
- **Anonymization** techniques for privacy
- Community detection using *Louvain method*
- Visualization of graph properties

## Datasets
- Wiki-Vote
- Email-Eu-core
- Soc-Epinions1
- Facebook Combined
- p2p-Gnutella08
## Results

The analysis includes:

- **Clustering Coefficient**: Evaluating the density of connections within clusters of nodes.
- **Graph Diameter**: Assessing the longest shortest path between two nodes.
- **NMI (Normalized Mutual Information)**: Comparing community structures before and after perturbations to evaluate privacy and utility.
- **Clustering Entropy**: Analyzing the variation in clustering coefficients to measure diversity and privacy.
